1. Architecture Overview
What is Three-Tier Architecture?
Explain three layers:
Presentation Layer (Frontend - HTML, CSS)
Application Layer (Flask - handles logic, API)
Data Layer (MySQL - stores/retrieves data)
Diagram of Architecture
Include a simple diagram like:

css
Copy code
[User] → [Web Browser] → [Flask App] → [MySQL Database]
Describe the flow of requests.

2. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up MySQL Database
Create notes_db, notes table, and flask_user.
Grant permissions (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES).
Step 2: Develop Flask Backend
Connect Flask to MySQL (mysql-connector-python).
Create routes for adding and retrieving notes.
Step 3: Build Web Interface
Design a simple form for adding notes.
Display stored notes dynamically.
Step 4: Run & Test the Application
Start Flask (python app.py).
Access web app (http://127.0.0.1:5000).
Add/view notes, check MySQL data.
3. Advantages & Challenges
✅ Advantages of Three-Tier Architecture
Separation of Concerns: Easy maintenance.
Scalability: Each layer can be upgraded separately.
Security: Database access restricted to the Flask app.
❌ Challenges Faced
Database Connection Issues: Debugging MySQL permissions.
Flask Routing & Template Errors: Handled through debugging.
Ensuring UI Responsiveness: Basic styling added.
4. Comparison with Other Architectures
Architecture	Pros	Cons
Single-Tier (SQLite)	Fast setup, lightweight	Not scalable, less secure
Two-Tier (MySQL + Python)	Direct database access	Harder to scale
Three-Tier (Flask + MySQL + HTML)	Best for web apps, scalable	Requires more setup
3. Presentation Tips
✅ Show a Working Demo: Open Flask app, add/view notes.
✅ Use Diagrams: Show how requests flow through the layers.
✅ Explain Benefits Clearly: Focus on scalability and security.
✅ Be Ready for Questions: Compare it with other architectures.
